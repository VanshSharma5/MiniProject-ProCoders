1. What is the default value of an uninitialized pointer in C++?
a) 0  
b) nullptr  
c) NULL
d) Garbage value  
Answer: d) Garbage value  
Explanation: In C++, uninitialized pointers contain garbage values unless explicitly set to nullptr or NULL.

2. Which of the following is the correct way to declare a constant in C++?
a) constant int x = 10;
b) const int x = 10;  
c) int const x = 10;  
d) Both b and c  
Answer: d) Both b and c  
Explanation: Both const int x = 10; and int const x = 10; are valid ways to declare constants in C++.

3. Which of the following is NOT a valid access specifier in C++? 
a) private 
b) public  
c) protected 
d) secure  
Answer: d) secure  
Explanation: private, public, and protected are valid access specifiers in C++, while secure is not.

4. What does the new keyword do in C++? 
a) Creates a new object of a class  
b) Allocates memory dynamically  
c) Creates a new function  
d) Initializes a variable  
Answer: b) Allocates memory dynamically
Explanation: new is used to allocate memory for a variable or object dynamically on the heap.

5. Which of the following is used to deallocate memory in C++?  
a) free()  
b) delete  
c) destroy() 
d) clear() 
Answer: b) delete  
Explanation: The delete operator is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated using new.

6. Which of the following functions is used to get the size of a data type in C++?  
a) sizeof()  
b) length() 
c) size()  
d) get_size()
Answer: a) sizeof()
Explanation: The sizeof() operator is used to get the size (in bytes) of a data type or object in C++.

7. What is the result of 10 / 3 in C++ when both operands are integers?  
a) 3.33 
b) 3  
c) 3.0  
d) Error  
Answer: b) 3  
Explanation: When both operands are integers in C++, the result of integer division is truncated, so 10 / 3 results in 3.

8. What is the purpose of a constructor in C++?  
a) To initialize an object  
b) To destroy an object  
c) To allocate memory dynamically  
d) To overload operators  
Answer: a) To initialize an object 
Explanation: A constructor is a special member function used to initialize an object when it is created.

9. Which of the following is a valid way to create an object of a class in C++?
a) Object obj;  
b) new Object;  
c) Object obj = new Object(); 
d) Both a and b  
Answer: d) Both a and b  
Explanation: You can create an object in C++ either statically (Object obj;) or dynamically (new Object;).

10. Which operator is used to access members of a structure or class in C++ when using a pointer?
 a) . (dot)  
 b) -> (arrow)  
 c) :: (scope resolution)  
 d) [] (brackets)  
 Answer: b) ->
 Explanation: The ->operator is used to access members of a class or structure when using a pointer.
